Reflections

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

Wireframing and creating an HTML page with Ian was very helpful in my understanding of different working styles. We had different layouts planned in advance that were created using different platforms. This allowed us both to gain some familiarity with tools the other was using.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

I personally found wireframing to be a very useful and tactical step in the developmental process. It gave me the opportunity to think about the visual components of my blog site in shapes without worrying about the content, colors, or font. Building a foundation in this way is great once you start to create sites that are geared towards ease of use and user experience.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

Ian and I both had great foundational basics in our wireframes. Mine may have been more detailed than necessary for this level of the process because some elements that I had listed we will not learn how to create til several weeks into the program.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

Ian and I discussed all of the semantic elements when deciding how to structure our pages. Without using div spans, we divided our page with head, nav, body, footer, and section elements.
