1. What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

  This challenge helped me to experiment with padding, borders, and margins on my own webpage in a way that I could really see how each element’s position affects every other element. Being able to utilize each of these properties really allows you to finetune the look of your site. Understanding these properties, how they work individually and along with one another can go a long way in creating beautiful dynamic web pages. Here is how these properties function:

    *Padding- the padding property can be used to specify uniform padding around a box. With two, three, or four values, sides can be specified independently. (padding, padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left.)

      ex: padding: 10px 20px 30px 40px;


    *Borders- The width, style, and color of all four sides of the border of a box. Border combines border-top, border-right, border-bottom, and border-left, along with border-width, border-style, and border-color.

      ex: border: 1px solid #000;


    *Margins- The margin of a box, outside the border, padding, and content areas. the margin property can be used to specify a uniform margin around a box. With two, three, or four values, sides can be specified independently.

      ex: margin: 10px 20px 30px 40px;



2. What did you learn about CSS positioning?

  CSS positioning allows you to adjust the location of elements in the space of the web site relative to the margins or one another (how it’s position is calculated). A box can be positioned with the top, right, bottom, and left properties. These will have different effects depending on the value of position:

    *Static - Follows the normal flow in a layout. top, right, bottom, andleft have no effect. Default.

    *Relative - Position is offset from the box’s initial position.

    *Absolute - Box is taken out of the flow and positioned in relation to its containing box.

    *Fixed - The same as absolute only the box will remain fixed in the viewport and will not scroll with the rest of the page’s content.


3. What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

  The aspects of my design that I found the easiest to implement were the general layout, as in breaking things up into sections on the page. The most difficult but also fun aspect was experimenting with exact location, size, and shapes of each element.

4. What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

  In this challenge I was able to format the color, font, size, etc to achieve the desired appearance.
