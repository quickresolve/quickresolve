    <h4>
    What are the benefits of version control?
    </h4>
    <p>
    In order to really describe the benefits of Version Control Systems, lets first look at the problems with Manual Version Control.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Difficult to separate permanent updates from experimental changes.</li>
    <li>Very complex if you are dealing with multiple document solutions.</li>
    <li>When multiple people are working together, it can be labor intensive to even find the differences between the versions, let alone merge them to a single document.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Version Control (aka Revision Control aka Source Control) lets you track your files over time. Version Control Systems have the following abilities:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Backup and Restore</li>
    <li>Synchronization</li>
    <li>Short-term undo</li>
    <li>Long-term undo</li>
    <li>Track Changes</li>
    <li>Track Ownership</li>
    <li>Sandboxing</li>
    <li>Branching and merging</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Version Control Systems allow multiple people to manage and share files. It enforces discipline by managing the process of passing files to one another. It allows you to archive versions. Maintains historical information to compare versions. Enables collaboration. Recover from accidental deletions or edits. Conserves disc space on control client and on server - uses efficient algorithms to store changes without taking up too much space. Automates the process of keeping revisions. Most support a branching option to keep the master data safe to keep reformatting separate from working version.
    </p>
    <p>
    To better understand Version Control, we need to look at an actual example. Two of the most popular version control systems are mercurial and git.
    </p>
    <h4>
    How does git help you keep track of changes?
    </h4>
    <p>
    Git is an open-source version control system that allows developers to track changes made on their code files throughout the lifetime of a project. Git was created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux who wanted a better way to track changes in software development. Git helps you to track changes with 3 stages: Committed, Modified, and Staged.
    </p>
    <p>
    Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database. Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet. Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.
    </p>
    <h5>
    To follow the Git workflow do the following:
    </h5>
    <img src="https://git-scm.com/images/about/index1@2x.png" width="250">
    <ol>
    <li>You modify files in your working directory.</li>
    <li>You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area.</li>
    <li>You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area (index) and stores that snapshotpermanently to your Git directory.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
    You may be asking yourself, who should use Git? Git is for anyone who wants to track edits to text documents. Great for anyone who needs to share changes with collaborators. Good for anyone not afraid of command line tools. It is not as useful for tracking non-text files, or files that need to be interpreted by a word processor.

    </p>
    <h4>
    Why use GitHub to store your code?
    </h4>
    <p>
    Github lives remotely, on the Internet - You can store and access your work online, on GitHub, but only if you EXPLICITLY SEND IT THERE â€” i.e via a git push
    </p>
    <p>
    A GitHub repository is essentially the same as a folder on your computer, except that it's on the web. It can have folders, also called directories, and files. Repositories generally hold all of the code for a web application.
    </p>
    <p>
    GitHub helps by acting as a Version Control System in the cloud that can be utilized by many users at the same time (Distributed Version Control) allowing for accountability and collaboration between individuals.
